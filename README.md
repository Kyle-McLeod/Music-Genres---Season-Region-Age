## Questions:
Is there any major differences in music streaming between the year of COVID and the year of 2019? What is the most popular genre amongst them all and when is music streaming at an all time high?

## Hypothesis:
District 9 believed music streaming volume would increase significantly and Pop music would reign as the supreme  genre during the COVID pandemic because people still wanted to stay connected through music. 



## Summary
The music industry has faced numerous challenges over the years, but none are as disruptive as the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world faced a global health crisis and governments implemented lockdown measures, music streaming continued to be an important part of people's daily lives. According to our analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on music streaming consumption, there was an increase in streaming due to the number of people that were at home, while at the same time, there was a shift in what people were searching for.

Through our research, we found that the COVID-19 outbreak increased the number of streams on the platform, as individuals had more free time available to utilize music streaming services. We have investigated the impact of COVID-19 on music consumption habits using data collected during the pandemic initial impact from 2019 to 2020.
